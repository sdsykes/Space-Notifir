Space-Notifir
=============

This is an alternative Display Notificaiton System for TotalSpaces 2 to indicate the current Space on change

This Mac OS X App is a tiny Menu Bar App that triggers an alternative Notification whenever you change the current Space, but this relys on TotalSpaces 2 to work

Notice: This App doesnt use the TotalSpaces 2 API to get the current apace Number, it uses a pre-built Command Line Executable
to obtain the current Space Number, this is a barebone release, there is still enough air for improvements, but its basically an alternative demo to play around and to increae the visibility of the Notifications used in total spaces.

Know Issue:

The Notification remais on screen for 1 second, switching faster than 1 second between Spaces, causes a minor timeout loop so the notification doesnt appear corrently or stays invisible...
